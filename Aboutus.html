       <p> Pentecost University (PU) traces its history to the year 1954
        when The Church of Pentecost started a World Mission Bible
        College (WMBC).</br> In February 1972, WMBC which had not
        been active for a long time was re-started as Pentecost Bible
        Centre (PBC) at the McKeown Temple in Kumasi,</br> with an
        initial enrollment of five. Rev. David Mills was the first
        Principal. Rev James McKeown, founder of The Church of
        Pentecost (COP), and Rev Joseph Egyir-Paintsil,</br> the General
        Secretary, performed the opening ceremony. The Centre
        was closed in 1975, and was reopened at New Abossey
        Okai, Accra, in 1983.</p></br>
        <p>In 1984, the Pentecost Bible Centre moved from Kumasi to
            Madina-Accra. Rev. Martinson K. Yeboah was the first Dean
            of Students for PBC, serving from 1984 to 1986.</br> Following
            Rev. M.K Yeboah as Dean of Students were Rev. L. A. Nyarko
            (1986-1989), Rev. Emmanuel Parker (1989-1992),</br> Rev.
            Samuel Opoku-Adipah (1992-1999), Rev. Kwame Blankson
            (1999-2003) and Rev. Daniel O. Walker (2003-2005 &
            2010-2016), </br>Rev. Joshua Yirenkyi Smart (2005-2010), Rev.
            Paul Danso (2016-2020) and Rev. Jonathan Kofie (2020-
            date). The position of Director of Studies, now abolished,
            was held by Rev. Dr. Amponsah–Kuffour (1992-2003).</p>
        <p>The Pentecost University Council, first headed by Elder Dr.
            Paul Awua, was inducted on May 6, 2004 at the 10th Session
            of the Extraordinary Council Meeting of the Church of
            Pentecost held at the University’s Sowutuom campus.</br> He
            was succeeded by Her Ladyship Mrs. Elizabeth Ankumah
            who served from 2012 to 2020. Currently, the Council is
            under the Chairmanship of Rev. Prof. Otoo Ellis.</br>
            Through hard work, commitment and dedication to duty on
            the part of faculty, staff and students, the Pentecost University
            College became a fully-fledged chartered University on 1</br>
            June 2020 after President Akuffo Addo presented the charter
            certificate to the University on 28th May 2020 at the Jubilee
            House in Accra. Pentecost University is therefore among the
            few private universities in Ghana to become a chartered</p>
